When you think of all the late nights
Late fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin'
With someone, but feeling alone

A heart is drawn 'round your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killing time
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned, they intertwined
And taught you the way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady, all that I can say is

All of the girls you've loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now, you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you've loved before
And I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
We're breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without saying goodbye (Ooh)
Just know that it's everything that made me
Now, I call you "baby," that's why you're so amazing

All of the girls you've loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now, you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you've loved before
And I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

The girls you've loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Every dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now, you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you've loved before
I love you more
