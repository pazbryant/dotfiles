People like you always want back
the love they gave away
People like me wanna  believe you
when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
off the road

Stay
Hey - all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then,
why'd you have to go and lock
me out
when I let you in
Hey - now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now
Calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up pieces of the mess you
made
People like you always want back
the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

Stay
Hey - all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then,
why'd you have to go and lock
me out
when I let you in
Hey - now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Let me remind you...
this was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stay

Hey - all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then,
why'd you have to go and lock
me out
when I let you in
Hey - now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy

Hey - all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then,
why'd you have to go and lock
me out
when I let you in
Hey - now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
