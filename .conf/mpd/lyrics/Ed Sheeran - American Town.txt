We're a long way from home
Haven't seen you in so long
But it all came back in one moment
And the year started cold
But I didn't notice at all
When we found there's a room we're both in

We get Chinese food in small white boxes
Live the life we saw in "Friends"
Your room, it barely fits the mattress
Wake up, leave for work again
The wind, it seems to blow right through us
Down jackets are the trend
The rush of rushing deep into love

English girl in an American town
No elevator to the 5th floor, I'll
Ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town
In an American town

The days come and go
But it ends when doors close
And the scent of your perfume's on me
You're useless with your phone
Electric when one-on-one
I thought I would be more nervous, darling

We watch comedies and miss the endings
Conversations 'til the dawn
Any change in tide, we push against it
Challenge meanings in the songs
Then head out without a reservation
Drinking out of paper bags
And wasting time is time not wasted

With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the 5th floor, I'll
Ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town

And when our eyes are closed together, I can't explain
How the scent of your perfume takes me to a higher place
We can watch it unfold, or we can change how it tastes
And rebuild when it breaks down

We drink Moscow Mules and steal the cups from
Mostly The Bowery bar
What a perfect day to fall in love on
What a way to make it start
It appears when you think all is lost, then
You don't remember when it started
Never have to pretend

With my English girl in an American town
No elevator to the 5th floor, I'll
Ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me

English girl in an American town
No elevator to the 5th floor, I'll
Ring on the buzzer, then you'll be right down
I wish time would freeze
Dungarees over the hoodie, we're out
Feet are three feet off the ground
Lost in love and we don't wanna be found
It's just you and me
My English girl in an American town
