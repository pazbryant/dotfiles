Kaleidoscope love, yeah, that is you and me
Forever changing, we make life interesting
Some days we're red and, some days we both think green
But I like the nights when we leave the canvas free

Grab a brush and see where the feeling may lead
Nothing is out of our reach
Our words are mixing the pigment we need
Can we get started?

I keep falling, deeper in dark blue
Brightеr than white
Rainbows, еxploding
But I can't see nothing except you and your eyes
Maybe we'll just paint the night colourblind

In every spectrum, we find the millionth piece
Connect the dots and everything in between
Dull in the moment, you'll turn it golden leave
You take the dark away, and that's no easy feat

Pick an orange, watch the shape change in the heat
From yellow, purple and green
Your  words are mixing the pigment we need
Can we get started?

I keep falling, deeper in dark blue
Brighter than white
Rainbows, exploding
But I can't see nothing except you and your eyes
Maybe we'll just paint the night colourblind
Maybe we'll just paint the night colourblind
