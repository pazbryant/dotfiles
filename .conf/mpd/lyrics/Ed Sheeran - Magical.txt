One touch, electric shock, eyes locked
Like did you feel that too?
World stops, just us, here under dots
In the darkness of the blue, out of the blue

Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical

Our lips barely one inch
Your skin brushed by my fingertips
Mornings, white mist, so delicate
Covers as we begin, as we begin

Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical

Silence is filled, as time stands still
Our thoughts in the open room
Lay here until the sun distills
Its light for the perfect view, now I'm with you

Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
Is this how it feels to be in love?
This is magical, this is magical
