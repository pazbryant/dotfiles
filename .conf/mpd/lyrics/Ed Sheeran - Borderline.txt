Sadness always finds an in
Sneaks its way past infecting everything
And every chapter has an end
But this is one momentous sequel don’t you think?

And the blackbirds they fly
Like a frown on the skyline

Right now I feel I’m running from the light
Engulfed in darkness
Shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out
I’m stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?

Guess I should take this on the chin
But I don’t even know how all of this began
We are made to mould and bend
How can I wish for nothing when it’s still a sin?

Right now I feel I’m running from the light
Engulfed in darkness
Shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out
I’m stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?

Tears never arrive
These ducts are dry
We are so blind
Waiting on the borderline
Waiting on the borderline

So I will pour another drink
And try to drown the pain with salt along the rim
And I’ll shut off the things I think
‘Coz nothing good will ever come from worrying

Right now I feel I’m running from the light
Engulfed in darkness
Shielded from my eyes
One foot in, one out
I’m stuck on the borderline
Which way will I?

Tears never arrive
These ducts are dry
We are so blind
