Came in through the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know

The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't br–µak my boat
