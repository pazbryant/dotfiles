I don't know what to think
The word cut through the day
The doctor said it's cancer
And the baby's on the way
Life changes in a blink
Decisions to be made
They say radio's the answer
And that both lives can be saved

Points for timing, it could not get worse
What the hell are we going to do?
But you're the type to defeat the hardest obstacles
Put in front of you

You are the toughest in the room
And I know that love will get us through
And life will overcome the pain that grows in you
'Cause you are the toughest in the room
You showed me strength I never knew
When love is on our side
There's just no way to lose
But I still can't help but break down

Still waiting on a call
Then an action plan is made
In the middle of a court case
Shows what really matters, babe
The specialists in North
En route we'll choose our child's name
'Cause we've had enough surprises for a lifetime, wouldn't you say?

The word he said, it had the upmost power to
Change the world to blue
But you're the type to defeat the hardest obstacles
Put in front of you

You are the toughest in the room
And I know that love will get us through
And life will overcome the pain that grows in you
'Cause you are the toughest in the room
You showed me strength I never knew
When love is on our side
There's just no way to lose
But I still can't help but break down

All night long
Tossing and turning and begging
Please hold on

'Cause you are the toughest in the room
I know that love will get us through
And life will overcome the pain that grows in you
'Cause you are the toughest in the room
You showed me strength I never knew
When love is on our side
There's just no way to lose
But I still can't help but break down
